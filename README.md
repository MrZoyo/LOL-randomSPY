### New Random Champion Selection System
- ARAM CLASH is popular. But as we all know, unfortunately the LOL game itself only has a self-selected mode and a random mode without Re-Rolls. So a feature was added to simulate ARAM CLASH with 15 random champions for each team. You can play ARAM CLASH with this feature in the self select mode and of course, you can also create games with spies using this feature.

## V0.0.1 - Initial version
- Support one spy and two spies modes.
